# Particle Galaxy Animation with Shaders ðŸŒŒ

### This project demonstrates how to use GPU-powered shaders to animate a particle galaxy efficiently. By leveraging the vertex shader, we achieve smooth animations and dynamic effects without sacrificing performance. Key features include:

#### Rotating Particles: Animates particles at varying speeds based on their distance from the center, creating a mesmerizing rotational effect.
#### Custom Particle Patterns: Replaces default square shapes with visually appealing patterns for the particles.
#### GPU Optimization: Utilizes the GPU to handle vertex animations directly in the vertex shader, ensuring high performance compared to CPU-based approaches.

### The goal of this repository is to explore particle animation techniques using shaders, ideal for interactive visuals and real-time applications.
