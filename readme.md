# Particle Galaxy Animation with Shaders ðŸŒŒ

#### This project demonstrates how to use GPU-powered shaders to animate a particle galaxy efficiently. By leveraging the vertex shader, we achieve smooth animations and dynamic effects without sacrificing performance. This repository is perfect for developers looking to create captivating particle animations for interactive and real-time applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### ðŸŒŒ Rotating Particles
#### Animates particles at varying speeds based on their distance from the center, creating a mesmerizing rotational effect.

### ðŸŒ  Custom Particle Patterns
#### Replaces default square shapes with visually appealing patterns for the particles, adding a unique aesthetic to the galaxy.

### âš¡ GPU Optimization
#### Utilizes the GPU to handle vertex animations directly in the vertex shader, ensuring high performance compared to CPU-based approaches.
